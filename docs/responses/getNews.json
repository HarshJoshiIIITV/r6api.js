      "content": "The Y5S2.1 Patch will deploy to PC and Console the week of June 29th. The new Match Cancellation will also be going live with this update.\n\n# GAME UPDATES\n\n### MATCH CANCELLATION\n\n*Match Cancellation will go live with the Y5S2.1 update! We have tested it on the TS and as well as internally against a number of potential circumstances. However as it is a new feature, please let us know if you have any feedback or issues to report with Match Cancellation at [r6fix.ubi.com](https://r6fix.ubi.com/).*\n\nMatch Cancellation is a new feature that will allow players to cancel their current Ranked match under the condition that team sizes are unbalanced at the beginning of the match (eg: if players disconnect before the first round, or if a lobby is formed with less than 10 players). The Match Cancellation vote option will become available for the incomplete team during the prep phase and a majority vote will cancel the match. A canceled match will show as canceled and have no impact on MMR.\n\nAbandon penalties are still in place and players who abandon an ongoing Ranked Match are still subject to escalating abandon sanctions.\n\nIf a match cancellation vote is triggered, leaving before the validation of the Match Cancellation vote will also result in an abandon penalty. Players should remain in the game until the Match Cancellation vote is validated and the game has been canceled.\n\n# BALANCING\n\n### Melusi\n\n- Lowered the penalty zone by approximately 33%.\n- Reduced max range penalty radius from 6m to 4m (range in which penalty increases from 25% to 50% the closer you get to the gadget)\n- Reduced critical Range penalty radius from 3m to 2mÂ (range in which penalty is 50%)\n*See diagram below for how Banshee's penalty ranges work.*\n![RangeRefacto2](//staticctf.akamaized.net/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/7jY8LaPaRdlJOjVOm1Ql6p/a8acf8c55212de7efb3cdb72bf10779f/RangeRefacto2.png)\n- Lowered the sound of the Banshee effect in first person POV.\n \n### Ace & Hibana\n\n- Explosion damage can no longer pass through reinforced walls and destroy fragile gadgets on the other side when you place Hibana's X-Kairos and Ace's SELMA on the floor.\n\n# BUG FIXES\n\n### GAMEPLAY\n\n- FIXED â€“ Inconsistent runout detection timer meant detection would sometimes take longer than 2s.
